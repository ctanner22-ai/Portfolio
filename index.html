    <h3>Why I Like These Games</h3>
    <p1>
      <ul>
      <li> Minecraft has great asthetics and I love that the player is able to roam freely and do whatever the player chooses to do.</li>
      <li> Lego Star Wars is nostalgic for me because I grew up playing it. What is good about this game is the story and asthetics. There is not many choices that are made by the player during the game, but the story is still interesting.</li>
      <li>Call of Duty is absolutly epic. My favorite thing to do on this game is to play the zombies mode where each round gets harder as there are stronger zombies and more of them.</li>
      </ul>
